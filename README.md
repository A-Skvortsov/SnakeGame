# SnakeGame
Intro to CS Summative Project

Written in Java using NetBeans 8.2 IDE

This was a project done by two students and I as a summative course project. It took a fair amount of research and planning, all of which is shown in the attached PDF document titled "Snake Game Report". This document includes a flowchart model, program specifications, notes on design/implementation, testing processes, etc. If there are any questions or confusion, the document should help understand. The file titled "Game Code" shows pretty much all the code required for the game outside of program-setup-related aspects (Java imports required to run the code, GUI setup, etc.). PNG files show all images the game needs to be able run.

**P.S. The .jar file is safe to download but I have included screenshots of gameplay.
