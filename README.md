# SnakeGame
Grade 11 Intro to CS Summative Project

This was a project done by two students and I as a summative course project. It took a fair amount of research and planning, all of which is shown in the attached PDF document titled "Snake Game Report". This PDF includes a flowchart model, program specifications, notes on design/implementation, testing processes, etc. If there are any questions or confusion, the PDF should help understand. The file titled "Game Code" shows pretty much all the code required for the game outside of program setup related aspects (java imports required to run the code, GUI setup, etc.). PNG files show all images the game needs to be able run.

**P.S. the jar file is safe to download but I understand the risk in downloading random executables off the internet so I have included screenshots of gameplay. Enjoy!
